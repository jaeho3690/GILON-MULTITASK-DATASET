## 🍫 The GILON Multi-task Dataset

Greeting from the GILON Multi-task Dataset!

This dataset is the joint work of GILON company and the UNIST Data Mining Lab. The dataset contains 72 people wearing smart insoles performing 14 different types of experiments.
Three different labels are given to each data chunk: type of action, running speed, and body weight. We release a pre-processed dataset with a time window of 4 seconds (160-time points per chunk, 40hz).

This multivariate time series dataset can be used to train and evaluate various applications with time series data, such as multi-task learning, time series classification, time series clustering, etc.
